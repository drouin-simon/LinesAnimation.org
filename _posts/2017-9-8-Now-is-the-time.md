It was a first for Lines, perhaps a world premiere: 8 animators in Montreal, Canada, 30+ in Milan, Italy. All drawing simultaneously on the same animation sequence with 20 Surface Pro 4 tablets, courtesy of Microsoft Italy and Microsoft Canada. The performance marked the end of the 3 days workshop entitled “Now it the time” that was organized by [Arkipelag](https://arkipelagblog.wordpress.com/) and took place at [Mare Culturale Urbano](http://maremilano.org/) in Milan, Sept 6-8. Below is the resulting animation.
