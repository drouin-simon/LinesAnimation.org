Lines was demo'd at SAT yesterday as part of an [NFB sponsored event](http://sat.qc.ca/fr/evenements/minotaur) around the projection of the film Minautaur by Munro Ferguson. Several Lines workstations were provided by the NFB. Artists taking part in the popular "Music to draw to" gathering organized by Kid Koala in parallel were invited to participate in the creation of a collaborative animation piece using Lines. Here's the result of their work.
