The Ottawa International Animation Festival (OIAF) organized a collaborative animation session yesterday as part of their [NightOwl event](https://www.animationfestival.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=259&Itemid=1037). The NFB sponsored the event and provided equipment. Lines was used to draw and connect everyone. The evolving animation loop was projected on a large screen for the rest of the audience.
